%VECVALDER/GT (vv2 version) tests greater than (>) if at least one of u, v is a
%vecvalder, returning a vector of logicals. ONLY VALUES ARE COMPARED FOR 
%EQUALITY; DERIVATIVES ARE IGNORED.
%
% NO SIZE CHECKS (for efficiency): we rely on MATLAB's built-in > for 
% numeric arguments to catch size inconsistencies.
