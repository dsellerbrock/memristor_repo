%    LPGL. You must clearly specify the license terms and identify the Copyright
%    Holder in the file 00-contribution-LICENSE under the subdirectory.
%
%  - For any additions you make to an EXISTING subdirectory of the contribs/
%    directory, you must assign copyright for your changes to the
%    Copyright Holder of the subdirectory and accept the license for
%    the subdirectory (as noted in the file 00-contribution-LICENSE therein).
