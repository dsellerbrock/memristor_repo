%MAPP allows you to define device models, "build" circuits using them and 
%simulate these circuits in various ways.
%
%This quickstart is organized in several steps. We recommend going through
%them sequentially:
%
%1. MAPPquickstart_cktdemos: how to build circuits using standard electrical
%   devices that are pre-defined in MAPP, and to run DC, AC, and transient
%   analyses on them - all in MATLAB. 
%
%2. MAPPquickstart_DAEs: how to define and simulate your own systems of 
%   nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) in MAPP. Going through
%   this is important for understanding compact models (ModSpec) and the
%   simulation capabilities of MAPP.
%
%3. MAPPquickstart_ModSpec: how to define compact models for your own devices,
%   use them in circuits and simulate them in MAPP.
