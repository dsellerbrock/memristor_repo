%ModSpec wrapper is a convenient high-level wrapper that MAPP provides on top
%of its low-level ModSpec API. This wrapper hides all the low-level details 
%of the ModSpec API from you. Instead it gives you three simple functions
%(ee_model, add_to_ee_model, and finish_ee_model) that have a much simpler
%calling syntax, that do all the low-level work for you. To learn more, 
%please see the help for these functions (particularly add_to_ee_model).
%
%Note: if you are new to the ModSpec, we recommend that you also take a look 
%at MAPP's Model Starter ("help model_starter") -- an interactive script that
%makes it even easier to define ModSpec wrapper compliant device models.
