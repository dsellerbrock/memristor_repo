%function out = simpleTwoPtFiniteDifference(last_2_ts, last_2_xs)
%This function provides an approximation to xdot(tn) consistent with the LMS
%method.
%INPUT args:
%   last_2_ts       - two consecutive times steps (1x2 sized array)
%   last_2_xs       - two consecutive xs (1x2 sized array)
%
%OUTPUT:
%   out             - xdot(tn) approximation
%The help for this sub-function is incomplete <TODO>.
